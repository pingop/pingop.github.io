Hello there, My name is Sebastian.


I am a danish security enthusiast. I have a masters degree in cryptography, an OSCP and I suffer from too many interests.


My interests include, infosec, penetration testing, cryptography, reverse engineering, CTF's, exploitation, coding, whisky, and books. This blog will be devoted to any security related research, write-ups and learning I do in my spare time. The main goal is to document what I learn for my own sake, but hopefully someone else will find it interesting as well.
